        <div class="qa-group">
          <div class="qa">
            <h4>What does “village” mean to you? How would you define or describe “the village”?</h4>
            <p>
              Village is a community of connections: a network of mutually supportive relationships,
              role models for our children, and shared rituals like meals, tea, fireside chats,
              dancing, play, and co-creating spaces for healing, movement, exploration, and art. It
              feels like family-style support and stewardship of the land.
            </p>
            <p>
              A village is a way of life that feels closer to how we were meant to live. Traveling
              created that feeling of connection, whereas parenting young babies felt insular. As we
              move through uncertain times, building the village now is an essential act of
              sustainability and survival.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond that urgency, the dream is to build a dance community and become a hub for
              playful creativity. The village hosts sober daytime dance parties, family dance
              events, and traditions that attract open-minded people alongside a sustainable food
              forest.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="qa">
            <h4>What “ingredients” of your village are important to you?</h4>
            <p>
              Dancing and music, children and elders together, homeschooling and alternative
              learning, creativity, open-mindedness, playfulness, presence, low-drama community,
              motivation, self-responsibility, family, health, movement, healing, sustainability,
              integrity, and generous gift economies.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="qa">
            <h4>Values that ground the community</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Creativity, open-mindedness, and playfulness</li>
              <li>Presence, family, and community care</li>
              <li>Stewardship, sustainability, and truthful communication</li>
              <li>Motivation, self-responsibility, generosity, and gift exchange</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="qa">
            <h4>Location, roles, and governance considerations</h4>
            <p>
              The village is rooted here and close by. Because we own the space, we want to clarify
              roles and how caretaking or residency agreements are held. Governance should align
              with shared vision while honoring responsibility for the land.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="qa">
            <h4>Who are the people, roles, and contributions you imagine?</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Crafty and handy collaborators who help build and maintain the property</li>
              <li>Artists, performers, musicians, and teachers</li>
              <li>Grandparents, elders, and actual close family members</li>
              <li>Friends who bring ideas to life and help things get done</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="qa">
            <h4>Specific people you want to include</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Sisters, mom, and extended family</li>
              <li>Inviting dad to be more involved</li>
              <li>Daniel’s parents and wider family</li>
              <li>Friends near and far: Elle, Danny, Rose, and others we attract</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="qa">
            <h4>How do you deal with conflict or disagreement?</h4>
            <p>
              We agree not to handle conflict over text. Conversations happen in person or verbally,
              with implied agreements clarified upfront. When commitments are important, pair verbal
              check-ins with written notes so expectations stay clear.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="qa">
            <h4>What agreements and commitments unite the village?</h4>
            <p>
              We want overarching agreements tied to the shared vision, plus the practical bones of
              what it means for someone to stay here. These will keep evolving as the village grows.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="qa">
            <h4>How do the kids experience the village?</h4>
            <p>
              They learn gardening, sustainability, building, music, plays, and endless skills from
              other children and elders. There are dance parties, art, and random interests that we
              alone cannot provide.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="qa">
            <h4>How does the village provide for them?</h4>
            <p>
              The village offers long-term survival, sustainable futures, love, nourishment, and a
              lifelong love of learning. It fosters empathy, relationship skills, and gives kids
              time with others while parents collaborate on shared and individual projects. It also
              grants parents space for partnership and creative work.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="qa">
            <h4>How do your kids contribute to the village?</h4>
            <p>
              Through love, laughter, curiosity, and learning how to give. The hope is that they grow
              up understanding how to contribute and participate actively in community.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="qa">
            <h4>Current glimpses of the village</h4>
            <p>
              Mother’s helpers, nanny Gianna, visiting friends, and extended family calls provide
              support. NextDoor connections offered meals and companionship postpartum, and friends
              like Danny, Rose, Elle, and Ali bring shared interests. Past communal living brought
              joy alongside lessons about agreements and expectations.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="qa">
            <h4>Share more about life right now</h4>
            <p>
              Postpartum support from neighbors and helpers was nourishing, although coordinating it
              while caring for newborns proved challenging. FaceTime keeps distant family close, and
              there is a deep desire to include dad and nearby friends more regularly. The longing
              is for weekly family time and for loved ones who cherish the children to be present in
              everyday life.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="qa">
            <h4>Who is part of your village right now?</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Immediate family, even if geographically distant</li>
              <li>Sisters in Florida, Maine, and Washington, plus mom</li>
              <li>Friend Elle, friends Danny and Rose in Denver, and neighbor friends</li>
              <li>Two mother’s helpers, a supportive nanny, and friend Gio (navigating commitments)</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div class="qa">
            <h4>What feels missing?</h4>
            <p>
              Nearby grandparents, weekly time with family, aunties, uncles, community help with
              projects, dinners together, shared motivation, dance-loving creatives, and the steady
              presence of people who care deeply about the children.
            </p>
          </div>

        <div class="qa-group">
          <div class="qa">
            <h4>What does a day in the village feel like?</h4>
            <p>
              Regular walks with neighbors, people dropping in to help with shared visions, and
              hands in the garden or dance studio. Community gathers around dance and music,
              artists collaborate, families share dinners, and the babies have playmates and older
              role models nearby. The village thrives on magical celebrations and sustainable
              living.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="qa">
            <h4>Moments that surfaced during visioning</h4>
            <p>
              Planning projects with others over breakfast, coordinating dance events, dancing with
              the kids, dad teaching Finn how to build, sisters and friends sharing dinner, and
              seeing multiple projects actively moving across the property. Teachers flow in and out
              to support the children’s curiosity.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="qa">
            <h4>Imagine that you're waking up in the village of your dreams. Where are you? What do you see and sense?</h4>
            <p>
              Morning light pours into a home nestled on the land, surrounded by gardens and the
              dance barn. Children play nearby while birdsong and distant laughter signal neighbors
              already stirring. The air smells of breakfast and freshly brewed tea as the family
              stretches into a new day.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="qa">
            <h4>What is the morning ritual like, and how are you nourished?</h4>
            <p>
              Breakfast is shared around a lively table with family, visiting aunties, and friends
              who stayed overnight. Conversation flows from gratitude to music playlists to the
              day’s projects. The nourishment is as much relational as it is physical—hot meals,
              warm drinks, and the comfort of community presence.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="qa">
            <h4>How do you prepare for the day ahead? What are you looking forward to?</h4>
            <p>
              After breakfast everyone collaborates on the day’s intentions: tending the food
              forest, rehearsing for daytime dance gatherings, or inviting neighbors to help with a
              new build. There is excitement about joyful work—planning events, practicing music,
              and welcoming helpers who want to get involved.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="qa">
            <h4>What is the pace of your morning? Are you staying or heading out?</h4>
            <p>
              The rhythm is unhurried yet focused. Most mornings are spent on the land, opening the
              dance space or garden for collaborators. Sometimes the family heads to a neighbor’s
              plot or welcomes a caravan of friends arriving with tools and children in tow.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="qa">
            <h4>Describe arriving—whether you are arriving somewhere or others are arriving to you.</h4>
            <p>
              Friends arrive laughing, carrying baskets of produce or instruments. Kids splash into
              the yard and run toward the play areas. Elders park and stroll in, greeting everyone
              with hugs before settling into the kitchen or workshop spaces. Arrival feels like an
              embrace.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="qa">
            <h4>What are you doing, receiving, or contributing? How do you connect to creativity and purpose?</h4>
            <p>
              The day weaves between facilitating dance jam sessions, mapping garden beds, and
              setting up art projects for kids. Creativity flows through DJ practice, storytelling
              circles, and collaborative design. Purpose shows up in stewarding the land and holding
              space for people to express themselves.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="qa">
            <h4>Who else is around? What are they doing?</h4>
            <p>
              Grandparents share wisdom with the children, craftspeople tackle repairs, teachers
              host pop-up learning pods, and musicians rehearse for upcoming gatherings. Friends
              rotate through childcare, cooking, and building projects so everyone can contribute
              where they shine.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="qa">
            <h4>What does lunchtime look like?</h4>
            <p>
              Lunch is a potluck spread in the garden or under the shade of the barn. Everyone brings
              something they love—homegrown veggies, soups, breads—and meals are shared picnic style.
              Stories and laughter keep the energy bright.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="qa">
            <h4>How does the afternoon unfold?</h4>
            <p>
              After lunch there’s a soft transition: some take a siesta, others continue working on
              the barn studio or tending crops. Kids rotate between learning circles, play rehearsals,
              and building forts with guidance from elders. There is room for rest and for momentum.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="qa">
            <h4>What nourishes you personally throughout the day?</h4>
            <p>
              Stealing moments for dance practice, grounding barefoot in the soil, sharing tea with a
              mentor, or journaling in the loft overlooking the land. Music, movement, and meaningful
              conversations refill the cup.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="qa">
            <h4>How does the late afternoon feel?</h4>
            <p>
              The pace slows. Families gather to watch kids rehearse a skit while others harvest
              vegetables for dinner. Sunlight pours through the barn as musicians wind down rehearsals
              and folks check in on project progress before evening.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="qa">
            <h4>Describe dinnertime rituals.</h4>
            <p>
              Dinner becomes a ceremony—sometimes outside around a long table, other times in the
              barn amid twinkling lights. Everyone contributes: cooking, setting the altar, telling
              stories, or offering gratitude. Daniel often shares tales by the fire, and kids lead a
              song or dance.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="qa">
            <h4>What happens after dinner?</h4>
            <p>
              Evenings drift into fire circles, music jams, and quiet conversations beneath the
              stars. Loose ends—tidying shared spaces, coordinating tomorrow’s helpers—are wrapped up
              together before families peel off for bedtime.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="qa">
            <h4>How do you ready yourself for rest?</h4>
            <p>
              Bedtime includes checking in with the children, gratitude sharing, and gentle movement
              or meditation. Before sleep there is a moment to note what blossomed that day and what
              delights are on the horizon.
            </p>

          <div class="qa">
            <h4>What does the environment look and feel like as you close the day?</h4>
            <p>
              The home glows softly, art projects hang to dry, instruments rest beside the hearth,
              and the scent of herbs lingers in the air. Outside, the land is dotted with cozy
              gathering spaces—fire pits, garden beds, and play structures built by many hands.

            <h4>Who are you being throughout this day?</h4>

              A joyful host, grounded steward, and creative collaborator—someone who moves with
              generosity, invites play, and stays devoted to the vision of communal flourishing.

            <h4>What resistance or “yeah, but…” thoughts surfaced?</h4>
            <p>
              How many people can we truly hold in our lives? Do we really want potential drama? It
              feels important to honor personal space even while craving community. Past communal
              living brought joy—like the stretch when Vic and Gio lived with us—but also highlighted
              the need for clearer agreements.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is worry about judgment tied to past experiences online, including Daniel’s
              history, as well as finding common ground with local neighbors. The hope is that
              intentional events will attract the right people.

          <div class="qa">
            <h4>How do you imagine working with these obstacles?</h4>
            <p>
              Honoring clear boundaries, naming expectations early, and inviting transparent
              communication can keep drama at bay. Curating intentional gatherings, leading with the
              village values, and sharing the vision openly are ways to attract aligned people while
              easing fears about judgment.

              Days start around 5–6 a.m. with the hope of quiet time before the toddler wakes.
              Breakfast happens together, followed by outside play, naps around 10 or 11, and
              support from helpers in the afternoon when available. Some days include YMCA visits,
              park adventures, or toddler programs. Saturdays focus on music and DJ work while
              freelance projects weave through the week. Ecstatic dance gatherings in Denver offer

              Regular sober daytime dance parties, family-friendly celebrations, shared meals with

              barn and food forest—to life. Consistent playgroups and intergenerational learning are
